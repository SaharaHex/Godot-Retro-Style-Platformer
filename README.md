This project involves creating a Retro-Style ‘Platformer’, with simple actions, sound effects, enemy movements, and a parallax background. It started as a learning exercise to understand the available tools and techniques.

Currently, the game features one playable level. If time permits, I plan to add new features and further develop the project.
